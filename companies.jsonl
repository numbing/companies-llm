CARAMEL’s goal is to proactively address modern vehicle cybersecurity challenges applying advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques and also to continuously seek methods to mitigate associated safety risks. In order to address cybersecurity considerations for the already here autonomous and connected vehicles, well-established methodologies coming from the ICT sector will be adopted, allowing to assess vulnerabilities and potential cyber attack impacts. Although past initiatives and cybersecurity projects related to the automotive industry have reached to security assurance frameworks for networked vehicles, several newly introduced technological dimensions like 5G, autopilots, and smart charging of Electric Vehicles (EVs) introduce cybersecurity gaps, not addressed satisfactorily yet. Considering the entire supply chain of automotive operations, CARAMEL targets to reach to commercial anti-hacking IDS/IPS products for the European automotive cybersecurity and to demonstrate their value through the extensive attack and penetration scenarios.

Trust. Focus. Strength. Growth.\n\nProblem we're solving:\nAt CyCraft, it’s people-first, always. We’re disrupting the Cyber Defence Matrix segment most dependent on manpower: Response-Recovery. \n\nToday, cybersecurity burnout is at an all-time high. \n\nCISOs and security teams are uncertain of response efficacy without knowing why they were breached and are handicapped by incomplete solutions: EDR is not R, and manpower-dependent MDR is expensive and inconsistent. \n\nThis challenge is further compounded by the misalignment of customer-vendor interest. Post-breach, instead of driving time to respond, vendors often offer time and manpower-based solutions. \n\nOur solution:\nCyCraft is the world’s 1st forensics-based threat investigation platform to automate evidence-based incident reporting and response. \n\nWe empower incident response for incident responders by incident responders. Founded by cyber serial entrepreneurs with successful MnA exits to leading Israeli cyber MNCs, our 3 co-founders bring a combined 50 years of experience in state-sponsored APT investigations to build the world’s first AI-powered, out of the box, detect-response platform that automate: \n1. Reconnaissance with continuous threat hunting\n2. Reduction in alert fatigue with forensics-based detection\n3. Root cause analysis and discovery\n4. Remediation, Report (board and shareholders), and Resilience against Repeat attacks\n\nWe’re headquartered in Taiwan with offices in Japan, Singapore, and the USA.

Through a policy of \"educate, trust and verify\" we apply rules of behaviour and data handling specific to any given user or group of users and constantly monitor at the endpoint their compliance to those rules. Any potential transgression is then reported, with a clear audit trail, to the data owner or the user’s boss. This means that compliance is normally assured by influencing the mind-set of the user – certainty of capture is more effective than severity of punishment. This also ensures that many of the blanket “blockers” currently in use can be relaxed as people will self-police, allowing them access to otherwise blocked sites when appropriate. Security becomes everyone’s responsibility. \n\nToday our philosophy is being championed as People Centric Security by Gartner.

MecTho's products are both measurement and advanced classification systems, able to intepret an environment, to assess the possible anomalies and to consenquently make the suitable decisions. As regards logistics, Mectho's main product is the Double Detection System (DDS), an AI-based classifier able to inspect on a conveyor belt whether the item has been correctly singularised. The DDS has an additional function, called Morphological Detection System (MDS), able to determine what kind of item is currently analysed (parcel, flyer, envelope, out-of-gauge, ...). For the airport market MecTho has developed the Life Detection Unit (LDU), a measurement and classification system able to spot children and adults on moving conveyor belts or within critical areas often at the transitition between the landside and the airside areas. This system allows airports also to solve the well-known problem due to children playing on conveyor belts that are inadvertently carried to luggage security checks, so putting them in a condition of high danger. As regards access control, MecTho has designed and taken to the market the AntiPiggybacking System (APB2). This can be installed on revolving doors, booths and fast gates and is able to detect almost every attempt to fraudulently break the secuity check (piggybacking and tailgating). Mectho's founders have more than 15-year experience both in academia and in industry, its technology is protected by five patents.

This significantly enhances awareness and provides management information about trends, new hotspots and the overall effectiveness in terms of objective KPI’s.  \n\nBird Monitoring in Wind Farms\nIn a growing amount of cases, a permit to build a wind farm is given under the pre-condition that bird movements are monitored 24/7 during pre and post construction of the park. Then, a bird radar becomes a permanent part of the wind farms’ infrastructure. In some cases a ‘start-stop-mechanism’ is required: the Robin system monitors bird movements in real time, and is able to automatically shut down individual turbines to mitigate mortality. \n\nDrone Detection in Critical Environments\nSmall Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAV’s) or ‘drones’ pose a lot of new opportunities, but they also bring severe safety and security threats.

Analysing and processing big data requires high computational power and scalable AI solutions. Therefore, entirely new workflows must be developed from current applications that can be run efficiently on future high-performance computing (HPC) architectures at exascale. To tackle these topics, a new European Centre of Excellence \"Research on AI- and Simulation-Based Engineering at Exascale\" (CoE RAISE) was founded and is being funded by the EU.\n\nForschungszentrum Jülich coordinates the CoE RAISE, which was launched on 1 January 2021 with a total budget of around € 5 million. The CoE brings together eleven full partners and two third parties with expertise in AI and HPC. RAISE will be an excellent enabler for the advancement of these technologies in Europe on industrial and academic levels, and a driver for novel intertwined AI/HPC methods. These technologies will be advanced on the basis of representative use cases, covering a wide spectrum of academic and industrial applications, for example wind energy harvesting, hydrodynamics of wetting, manufacturing, physics, turbomachinery, and aerospace.\n\nRAISE aims at closing the gap in full loops using forward simulation models and AI-based inverse inference models in conjunction with statistical methods in order to learn from current and historical data. In this context, novel hardware technologies such as modular supercomputing architectures, quantum annealing, and HPC prototypes will be used to explore unseen performance in data processing. RAISE's European network will develop and provide best practices, support, and education for industry, SMEs, academia, and HPC centres on the Tier-2 level, attracting new user communities.
